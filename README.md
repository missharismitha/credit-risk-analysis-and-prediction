# 📊 Credit Risk Analysis and Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting credit risk using real-world loan data from LendingClub. The goal is to understand customer credit profiles and predict whether a loan is likely to default or not. I used Python for data cleaning, feature engineering, visualizations, and model building, along with a Streamlit dashboard to present insights interactively.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Credit risk evaluation is a crucial aspect for financial institutions in deciding whether a loan applicant is trustworthy. In this project, I built a pipeline that processes raw loan data, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and applies a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict the loan status.

Key steps include:
- Loading and cleaning the LendingClub loan dataset.
- Handling missing values, irrelevant columns, and categorical variables.
- Visualizing key trends like loan status distribution, interest rates, and their relationship with loan grade.
- Training a classification model to predict loan status based on customer and loan features.
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy score and classification report.
- Creating an interactive dashboard with Streamlit to bring all insights and model evaluation together in one place.
